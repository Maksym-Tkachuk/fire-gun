# fire-gun

Simple browser shooter running on the HTML canvas. Move with the arrow or
WASD keys, hold the mouse button to fire, and survive waves of skeleton
enemies.

## Updated map generation

The battlefield now has several layouts that are picked at random. Each
layout contains fewer obstacles so the player always spawns in a clear
area and enemies have more room to move.

## Boundless movement

Leaving the screen now wraps the player to the opposite side, removing the
blocking fence around the arena.
